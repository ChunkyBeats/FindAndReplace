obtained from http://jquery.com/download/

Bugs:
-----
Will progress into program even if no string is initially entered.  It will
only tell you later than there was an error.  Find and Replace is case
sensitive

Future Updates:
---------------
Tried to disable submit buttons when no text was present in a field,
but was unsuccessful.  Try implementing again later.
